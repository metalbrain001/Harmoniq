# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at

# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/logo.png
    - assets/icons/icon.png
    - assets/icons/icon2.png
    - assets/icons/harmoniq.png
    - assets/images/background.png
    - assets/images/background1.png
    - assets/images/background2.png
    - assets/images/background3.png
    - assets/images/baige.png
    - assets/images/instant.png
    - assets/images/harmony.png
    - assets/icons/apple.svg
    - assets/icons/google.svg
    - assets/icons/twitter.svg
    - assets/icons/x.svg
    - assets/icons/face-id.svg
    - assets/images/seawhite.png
    - assets/images/voltsnow.png
    - assets/images/harmon.png
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: SFCompact
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-Mono-Regular.otf
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-Mono-Bold.otf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-Mono-BoldItalic.otf
          weight: 700
          style: italic
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-Mono-Medium.otf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-Mono-MediumItalic.otf
